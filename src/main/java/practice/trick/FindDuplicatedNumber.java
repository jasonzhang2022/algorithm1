/*
 * Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive),
 *  prove that at least one duplicate number must exist.
 *  Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.
 *
 *
 *  Exactly the same problem as LinkedListCycleII
 */
/*
Approach 1: like linkedListCycle detection. Slow and fast point
approach 2. DAG cycle detection.
Approach 3. XOR
Approach 4: in place element touch detection.
