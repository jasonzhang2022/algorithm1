 *
 * Given an unsorted integer array, find the first missing positive integer.

For example,
Given [1,2,0] return 3,
and [3,4,-1,1] return 2.

Your algorithm should run in O(n) time and uses constant space.

If we put every number x to position x-1;
At the end, the first position without a number is missed.
